1. What is Telnet? 
-> Telnet is a network protocol that allows users to remotely access and manage devices and systems. This is a kind of Troubleshooting to confirm connectivity.
   It's used for a variety of purposes, including troubleshooting, network management, and remote administration.
   eg:- telnet <db-IP> 3306 -> If DB is running but backend is unable to connect for DB then we need to check DB security group ingress rules.
		ping <IP> -> to test network connectivity and troubleshoot network issues
		curl http://localhost:8080/health -> this is the health check, same server == localhost == 127.0.0.1
		telnet <backend-IP> 8080 -> To confirm backend, which is connected to the frontend server.
		netstat -lntp -> To confirm active Internet connections(only servers)
		
HTTP Methods and Status Codes
=============================
CRUD operations

GET -> getting/read from server
POST -> posting/create a record(information)
PUT -> update the information
DELETE -> delete the record/information

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status#informational_responses
100 - 1xx -> informational responses - signifying that the server has received a client request and is currently processing it
200 - 2xx -> success status code - means that the request was successful
300 - 3xx -> redirectional - a response code from a server that tells a browser to automatically redirect a request to a different URL
400 - 4xx -> client side error - indicate that there was an issue with the client's request. 
500 - 5xx -> server side error - represent errors, they are also referred to as HTTP Error Codes.

anjansriram.shop - 404 - NOTFOUND - clinet side error
403 - FORBIDDEN - you don't have access to that
401 - unauthorized - trying to login without credentials
405 - HTTP POST, If you use GET - method not allowed 
400 - bad request - check the payload data(json data) once again

500 - Internal server error - any issues between backend to database, server side error
502 - Bad Gateway - frontend not able to connect backend
503 - service temporarily unavailable


2. How to check memory of linux server? memory == RAM
-> free -> It will shows the info in bytes
   free -h -> It is a human readable format
   top -> which shows that memory consume info
   htop -> it will apply colors and shows very attractive/ task manager
   cat /proc/meminfo -> calculate every related file data and shows
   
3. RAM vs ROM: Key Differences?
Feature				RAM (Random Access Memory)								ROM (Read-Only Memory)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Definition			Temporary, high-speed memory used for active processes	Permanent memory storing firmware and system instructions
Volatility			Volatile (data is lost when power is off)				Non-volatile (retains data even when power is off)
Speed				Extremely fast											Slower than RAM but faster than secondary storage
Usage				Stores active processes, apps, and system data			Stores firmware (BIOS, bootloader, embedded software)
Read/Write			Read & Write (frequently changes)						Mostly Read-Only (some ROMs allow updates)
Types				DRAM, SRAM												PROM, EPROM, EEPROM, Flash ROM
Example in Devices	Running apps on a phone or PC	

-> Temporary storage for calculations | - BIOS/UEFI in computers
-> Firmware in microcontrollers
-> Boot ROM in smartphones |

4. Where Are RAM and ROM Used?
RAM -> Used by operating systems and applications for temporary data storage (e.g., running apps).
ROM -> Stores permanent system instructions (e.g., boot firmware in PCs, firmware in embedded systems).   

5. What is Extended RAM?
-> Extended RAM (Virtual RAM) is a feature that allows a device to use a portion of its internal storage (eMMC/UFS/SSD) as temporary RAM 
   when the physical RAM is full. It helps improve multitasking but is slower than real RAM because storage is not as fast as RAM.
   swap - reserved RAM from hard-disk
   In chrome, some unused tabs will placed on swap later on if you access then placed on RAM
   
6. How do you list top 10 high memory process?
-> ps aux --sort -%mem -> it will list out all the high memory usage files
   ps aux --sort -%mem | head -n 10 -> it will display top 10 in the list

7. Disk usage?
-> df -hT -> human readable format and it's type
   du -sh -> it will shows the disk usage files
   du -sh /* -> check from the root volume wich file will took more disk usage
   du -sh /usr/* -> we can also check inside the files/directories which will consume more memory
   du - sh * -> whithin a folder it shows all the memory consumed files
   
-> cat /proc/cpuinfo - it will shows the cpu info
-> netstat - network statitics

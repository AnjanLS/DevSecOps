1. Why Use Docker?
-> Works on any environment (dev, staging, production)
   Simplifies dependency management
   Faster app deployment
   Lightweight compared to VMs
   Great for CI/CD and microservices

2. Docker Architecture?
-> Docker Client: CLI or GUI tool to talk to Docker.
   Docker Daemon (dockerd): Background service that manages Docker objects.
   Docker Images: Read-only templates for containers.
   Docker Containers: Instances of Docker images.
   Docker Registries: (e.g., Docker Hub) to store and pull images.

3. Basic commands of Docker
-> docker --version                  # Check Docker version
   docker pull nginx                 # Download nginx image
   docker images                     # List downloaded images
   docker run -d -p 8080:80 nginx    # Run container in detached mode
   docker ps                         # List running containers
   docker ps -a                      # List all running and stopped containers
   docker stop <container_id>        # Stop a container
   docker rm <container_id>          # Remove container
   docker rmi <image_id>             # Remove image

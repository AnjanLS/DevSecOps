Virtual private cloud (VPC)
---------------------------
1. what is virtual private cloud?
-> VPC is a virtual network environment that allows you to launch AWS resources in a logically isolated section of the AWS Cloud.

2. How do we define the size of a VPC?
-> we define the size of the address by IP-address range, where we can launch AWS resources (like EC2 instances) in a customizable 
   virtual network.
   
   Think of it like creating our own private data center within AWS, we can control:
   * IP address ranges - /16 means 65,536 IP addresses (from 10.0.0.0 to 10.0.255.255).
   * Subnets (private/public) - Divide vpc into a segmented piece of a larger network into smaller sections.
   * Route tables - Rules that determine where network traffic is directed.
   * Internet gateways (to connect to the internet) - Allows communication between instances in our VPC and the internet.
   * NAT gateways (for private subnet internet access) - Lets private subnet instances access the internet without being exposed directly.
   * Firewalls (via security groups and network ACLs) - 	Virtual firewalls attached to Instances & subnets.

3. what is subnet?
-> subnet is a, vpc might have 1 address range but we can split them to multiple different IP-address range for multiple projects. 
   subnet mask is used to divide an IP address into two parts. One part identifies the host (computer), the other part identifies the 
   network to which it belongs.
   ex: 192.168.1.0/24 - which creates 256 IP addresses for projects and 5 are reserved for aws.
   
4. what is route table? 
-> It is a data structure that helps to routers to find the best path for forwarding the data packets to their destination. It is 
   essential for directing/dictates network traffic flows within and outside the vpc. defines how request goto the application.
   
5. what is gateway?
-> A gateway is a network device or node that acts as a entry and exit points for data between 2/more different networks especially they 
   use different network protocols. It enables the resources in our public/private subnets to connect to the Internet. Every subnet gets a 
   default gateway address and a broadcast address. private subnet uses NAT(Network Address Translation) gateway & public subnet uses 
   Internet gateway(IGW).
  
6. what is NAT gateway? and it's uses.
-> If the request access to the private subnet, It is a bad practice to expose the applications/server IP-address to the Internet.If we are
   trying to access the web application then we dont want to expose our private subnet/server IP-address to the web application. To avoid this 
   we need to do masking of IP-address this is called NAT gateway. It will mask/change the IP-address of server with the public IP-address
   with the load balancer is called SNAT or either with the router is called NAT gateway.
  
7. creating subnets in AWS?
-> In AWS have public and private subnets, we can create only either private/ public subnets or both without any equal balance.
   * Private IPs are used for communication within a VPC and not accessible directly from the internet, unless we configure a NAT 
   Gateway or VPN to allow traffic. eg: EC2
   * Public IPs are accessible from the internet, If an EC2 instance can be accessed from the internet through public IP address or an 
   Elastic IP (EIP).
   
8. what is firewall and why it needs?
-> It is a security system that monitors Incoming & outgoing network traffic based on pre-defined network rules, In this firewall 
   created for instances and load balancers. Load Balancer's security group allows HTTP/HTTPS from anywhere. EC2 instance's security 
   group allows traffic only from the Load Balancer.
   
9. VPC CIDR Calculation (IP Address Calculation)?
-> when we create a vpc , we define CIDR(classless Inter-Domain routing) block, which means a range of IP-address.
   Ex: A VPC with CIDR block 10.0.0.0/16
       /16 means 65,536 IP addresses (from 10.0.0.0 to 10.0.255.255).
	   1 Byte = 8 Bits - 256 128 64 32 16 8 4 2 = 2^8 which means 256 combinations.
	   2 Byte = 16 Bits = 2^16 which means 65536 combinations. /16 means 65,536 IP addresses (from 10.0.0.0 to 10.0.255.255) for host & network
    [8 bits].[8 bits].[8 bits].[8 bits] = 32bits divided into 4 parts called octets.
	Example: 192.168.1.1 - Each number between dots can go from 0 to 255.
	In CIDR, 192.168.1.0/24 
	        The first 24 bits are network part (fixed) - 192.168.1 - [8 bits].[8 bits].[8 bits] = 24bits
			The last 8 bits are for hosts (can change) - 0 to 255 - [8 bits] = 8bits, Last number → changes from 0 to 255 to give 
			different IP addresses.
	192.168.1.0 - Network address
	192.168.1.1	First host (usable) to 192.168.1.254 Last host (usable)
	192.168.1.255 - Broadcast address
	
	Subnet-Size		How Many IPs	Real-world Example
		/16			65,536 IPs		Renting a football stadium for a small birthday party (wasted space)
		/24			256 IPs			Renting a community hall — just right for a small to medium party
		/28			16 IPs			Renting a tiny studio apartment for a big party (people will not fit)
		
	/16 means : 16 bits for network + 16 bits for host.
	Host bits = 16 bits, So 2¹⁶ = 65,536 IP addresses.
	In AWS, we will get 65,531 IP addresses.
	
	/23 means : 24 bits for network + 8 bits for host left (because 32 - 23 = 9)
	Host bits = 9 bits, So 2^9 = 512 IP addresses.
	In AWS, we will get 507 IP addresses.
	
	/24 means : 24 bits for network + 8 bits for host left (because 32 - 24 = 8)
	Host bits = 8 bits, So 2^8 = 256 IP addresses.
	In AWS, we will get 251 IP addresses.
	
	/28 means : 28 bits for network part + Only 4 bits left for host part (because 32 - 28 = 4)
	4 bits ➔ 2⁴ = 16 IP addresses. 1 is network address & 1 is broadcast address (reserved) = 14 usable IP-addresses for real devices 
	(in normal networking).
	In AWS, they reserve 5 addresses, so we get 11 usable IPs.
	
	Summary of Reserved IPs in AWS:
    -------------------------------
	Reserved IP 	Address	Purpose
	First IP (.0)	Network address (identifies subnet)
					For example, in a /24 subnet (10.0.0.0/24), the first IP address, 10.0.0.0, is the network address. This is used to 
					represent the entire subnet and cannot be assigned to a device.
	Second IP (.1)	VPC Router (responsible for routing)
					For example, in 10.0.0.0/24, the second IP, 10.0.0.1, is reserved for the VPC router. It is responsible for routing 
					traffic to other subnets and external resources (like the internet, if you have an Internet Gateway).
	Third IP (.2)	DNS Server (resolves domain names)
					For example, in 10.0.0.0/24, 10.0.0.2 is reserved for AWS DNS services. This helps your instances resolve domain 
					names (like example.com) into IP addresses.
	Fourth IP (.3)	Reserved for future use
					Currently, this IP address doesn’t serve a defined purpose, but AWS may use it for other internal functions as the 
					platform evolves.
	Last IP (.255)	Broadcast address (broadcasts to all hosts in subnet)
					For example, in 10.0.0.0/24, the last IP address, 10.0.0.255, is the broadcast address. It is used for sending 
					messages to all hosts in the subnet.

vpc works in AWS
-----------------
There is an Internet Gateway attached to the VPC. Through the Internet Gateway, traffic enters the public subnet.
In the public subnet, the request first goes to the Load Balancer, which is associated with the public subnet.
The Load Balancer then forwards the request to a Target Group, which contains the application instances.
These application instances usually reside in private subnets (for security).
To ensure that traffic from the Load Balancer can reach the instances in the private subnet, we configure a Route Table.
The Route Table defines how traffic is routed within the VPC and ensures the Load Balancer knows how to send traffic to the application 
servers.

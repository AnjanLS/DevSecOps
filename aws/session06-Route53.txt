Route53
-------
1. what is DNS?
-> DNS stands for Domain Name System, Route53 provides DNS as a service. like EC2 provides compute as a service.
   It translates/maps our domain names(like example.com) into IP addresses(like 192.0.2.1), allowing users to reach websites and services.
   we can register the domain by using Route53 & create DNS records pointing to our EC2 Instance & s3 buckets & also add health checks.
   
2. what is Hosted zone?
-> A hosted zone stores the DNS records for a specific domain (like example.com) and tells Route 53 how to respond to queries.
   Public Hosted Zone -	For domains accessible from the internet (e.g., mywebsite.com)
   Private Hosted Zone	For domains used internally within a VPC (e.g., internal.company.local)

3. what's Inside a Hosted zone?
-> Each hosted zone contains DNS records, such as: 
| Record Type     | Purpose                         | Example                         |
| --------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
|   A record      | Maps domain to IPv4 address     | `example.com → 192.0.2.1`       |
|   AAAA record   | Maps domain to IPv6 address     | `example.com → ::1`             |
|   CNAME         | Alias one domain to another     | `www.example.com → example.com` |
|   MX            | Mail server for the domain      | Used for email routing          |
|   NS            | Lists name servers for the zone | Required to delegate DNS        |
|   TXT           | Verification and metadata       | Often used for SPF/DKIM         |

4. what is record?
-> A DNS record maps a domain name to an IP address
   
-> either we can purchase Domain name form AWS or some public DNS registrars (hostinger) & integrates using Route53 in AWS. then need to
   create hosted zones. In hosted zones we create a DNS records by using NS records by placing it into a public DNS registrars webiste 
   so the DNS masks IP address. To solve this problem Route53 is used, requests comes from the user and Route53 instercepts the requests
   and check in its DNS records and resolve the DNS name to the IP address of the load balancer to allow.
   
-> Route53 also supports health checks, If application hosted on 2 different availability zones/webserver it can saimultaneously checks 
   the health of the webserver by pinging every few minutes to get the packets without losing to confirm webserver is active/not. It 
   sends the request to the active webserver but If both active it will make load balancing.

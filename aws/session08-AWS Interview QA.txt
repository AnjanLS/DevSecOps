AWS Interview QA
----------------
1. You have been assigned to design a VPC architecture for a 2-tier application. The application need to be highly available & scalable?
   How would you design the vpc architecture?
-> To make it available we will create Instances in a 2/multiple availability zones, for scalability by using auto-scaling it wll take 
   care according to the number of requests it will scale-up the Instances. To deploy 2-tier application in a VPC, create 2 subnets 
   public & private. The public subnet would contain the load-balancers and be accessible from the Internet. The private subnet would 
   host the application servers.
   
2. Your organisation has a multiple suubnets. you want restrict outbound Internet access for resources in one subnet, but allow outbound 
   Internet access for resources in another subnet. How would you achive this?
-> To restrict the outbound Internet access for resources in one subnet, we can modify the route table associated with that subnet. In 
   the route table, we can remove the default route (0.0.0.0/0) that points to an Internet gateway. 
   This would prevent resources in that subnet from accessing the Internet. For the subnet where outbound Internet access is required,
   we can keep the default route pointing to the Internet gateway.
   
3. you have a VPC with a public subnet & a private subnet. Instances in the private subnet need to access the Internet for software
   updates. How would you allow Internet access for Instances in the private subnets?
-> To allow the Internet access for Instances in the private subnet, we can use Network attached gateway/a NAT Instance.
   we would place a NAT gateway/instance in the public subnet & configure the private subnet route table to send outbound traffic to the
   NAT gateway/instance. This way, instances in the private subnet can access the internet through the NAT gateway/instance.
   
4. you have launched EC2 Instance in your vpc, and you want them to communicate with each other using a private IP-address. what steps 
   would you take to enable this communication?
-> By default, Instance within the same vpc cn communicate with other by using private IP-address. To ensure this communication, we need 
   to make sure that instances are launched in the same vpc & are placed in the same subnet/subnets that are connected through a peering
   connection or a vpc peering link.
   Additionally, we should check the security groups associated with the instances to ensure that the necessary Inbound/outbound rules
   are configured to allow communication between them.
   
5. you want to implement strict network access control for your vpc resources. how would you achive this?
-> To implement granular network access control for vpc resources, we can use Network Acess Control Lists(ACL's)
	NACL are stateless & operate at the subnet level. we can define inbound and the outbound rules at the NACLs to allow or deny traffic 
	based on source and destination IP-address, ports and protocols.
	By carefully configuring NACL rules, we can enforce fine-grained access control for traffic entering & leaving the subnets.
	
6. Your organization requires an isolated environment within the VPC for running sensitive workloads. How would you set up this isolated 
   environment? 
-> To set up an isolated environment within the VPC, we can create a subnet with no internet gateway attached. 
   This subnet, known as an "isolated subnet," will not have direct internet connectivity. We can place the sensitive workloads in this 
   subnet, ensuring that they are protected from inbound and outbound internet traffic. However, if these workloads require outbound 
   internet access, we can set up a NAT Gateway or NAT instance in a different subnet and configure the isolated subnet's route table to
   send outbound traffic through the NAT Gateway/instance.
   
7. Your application needs to access AWS services, such as S3 securely within your VPC. How would you achieve this?
-> To securely access AWS services within the VPC, we can use VPC endpoints. VPC endpoints allow instances in the VPC to communicate 
   with AWS services privately, without requiring internet gateways or NAT gateways. We can create VPC endpoints for specific AWS 
   services, such as S3 and DynamoDB, and associate them with the VPC. This enables secure and efficient communication between the 
   instances in the VPC and the AWS services.

8. What is the difference between NACL and Security groups ? Explain with a use case ?
-> For example, I want to design a security architecture, I would use a combination of NACLs and security groups. At the subnet level, 
   I would configure NACLs to enforce inbound and outbound traffic restrictions based on source and destination IP addresses, ports, and
   protocols. NACLs are stateless and can provide an additional layer of defense by filtering traffic at the subnet boundary.
   At the instance level, I would leverage security groups to control inbound and outbound traffic. Security groups are stateful and 
   operate at the instance level. By carefully defining security group rules, I can allow or deny specific traffic to and from the 
   instances based on the application's security requirements. By combining NACLs and security groups, I can achieve granular security 
   controls at both the network and instance level, providing defense-in-depth for the sensitive application.

9. What is the difference between IAM users, groups, roles and policies ?
-> IAM User: An IAM user is an identity within AWS that represents an individual or application needing access to AWS resources. 
   IAM users have permanent long-term credentials, such as a username and password, or access keys (Access Key ID and Secret Access Key).
   IAM users can be assigned directly to IAM policies or added to IAM groups for easier management of permissions.
   
   IAM Role: An IAM role is similar to an IAM user but is not associated with a specific individual. Instead, it is assumed by entities 
   such as IAM users, applications, or services to obtain temporary security credentials. IAM roles are useful when you want to grant 
   permissions to entities that are external to your AWS account or when you want to delegate access to AWS resources across accounts. 
   IAM roles have policies attached to them that define the permissions granted when the role is assumed.
   
   IAM Group: An IAM group is a collection of IAM users. By organizing IAM users into groups, you can manage permissions collectively. 
   IAM groups make it easier to assign permissions to multiple users simultaneously. Users within an IAM group inherit the permissions 
   assigned to that group. For example, you can create a "Developers" group and assign appropriate policies to grant permissions 
   required for developers across your organization.
   
   IAM Policy: An IAM policy is a document that defines permissions and access controls in AWS. IAM policies can be attached to IAM 
   users, IAM roles, and IAM groups to define what actions can be performed on which AWS resources. IAM policies use JSON (
   JavaScript Object Notation) syntax to specify the permissions and can be created and managed independently of the users, roles, or 
   groups. IAM policies consist of statements that include the actions allowed or denied, the resources on which the actions can be 
   performed, and any additional conditions.

10. You have a private subnet in your VPC that contains a number of instances that should not have direct internet access. However, 
    you still need to be able to securely access these instances for administrative purposes. How would you set up a bastion host to 
	facilitate this access?
-> To securely access the instances in the private subnet, you can set up a bastion host (also known as a jump host or jump box). 
   The bastion host acts as a secure entry point to your private subnet. Here's how you can set up a bastion host:
   Create a new EC2 instance in a public subnet, which will serve as the bastion host. Ensure that this instance has a public IP address
   or is associated with an Elastic IP address for persistent access. Configure the security group for the bastion host to allow inbound
   SSH (or RDP for Windows) traffic from your IP address or a restricted range of trusted IP addresses. This limits access to the 
   bastion host to authorized administrators only. Place the instances in the private subnet and configure their security groups to 
   allow inbound SSH (or RDP) traffic from the bastion host security group. SSH (or RDP) into the bastion host using your private key or
   password. From the bastion host, you can then SSH (or RDP) into the instances in the private subnet using their private IP addresses.

EC2-Deep Dive(Elastic compute cloud)
------------------------------------
Elastic - elastic is a pre-fix to some of the services in aws, services can be elastic in nature scaled-up/ scaled-down i,e. we can 
          increase the resources decreases the resources or use the resources in anywhere.
compute - we are requesting to aws to provide computing instance/virtual server which is a combination of cpu, RAM and disks.
cloud - the use of virtualized computing resources that are accessed over the internet, rather than being physically located on your 
        own hardware.
		
1. what is ec2?
-> we are requesting to aws the public cloud provider to give you a virtual machine/server which is elastic in nature and this term in 
   general is called as a compute.
   
2. why we need to use ec2?
-> Instead of using aws vm's, if we use own physical server by creating on our own vm's on top of hyper-visor then we need to maintain 
   timely upgrade the versions, verify the security Issues, server connectivity and many other issues for all the created vm's. single 
   devops engineer will not able to maintain all these areas, so to get rid of this maintainence we are moving to the public cloud 
   Infrastructure it will take care of everything and also cost reduces compare to using our own Infrastructure. During the shutdown 
   period no need to maintain the servers in aws.
   
3. ec2 instance types?
-> a. general purpose - instances offer a balance of computing, memory, and networking resources. eg: e-commerce website hosting
   b. compute optimized - instances are designed for compute-intensive applications that require high-performance processing. 
						  eg: research institution running simulations on a climate model. 
   c. memory optimized - instances provide a high amount of memory to handle large datasets and memory-intensive workloads. 
						 eg: social media platform storing and processing user data in memory for real-time analysis. 
   d. storage optimized - instances offer high storage capacity and I/O performance for workloads that require substantial storage. 
						  eg: company storing customer transaction data in a high-capacity data warehouse for analysis. 
   e. accelarated compute - instances utilize hardware accelerators, such as GPUs or FPGAs, to boost the processing power of specific tasks. 
							eg: gaming company running a server for online multiplayer games that require high graphics processing. 

4. what is regions in aws?
-> There are multiple regions in aws, suppose if we are working for european client they want the data as close to them because it's very
   sensitive then we can use the regions which are close to them it reduces the latency. aws have data centers in multiple places and 
   those are called as availability zones.

5. steps to create and login to instance in aws?
-> select a service EC2 -> click on instance -> launch instance -> name of the web-server -> application & os images -> Instance type ->
   key-pairs -> security groups in network settings. -> configuring storage -> number of instances -> launch instance -> created
-> key pair is a authentication to the instance which generates private and public key, instance have public key & we will have private 
   key using the private key we can login to that instance. do not share the private keys with anyone.
   key pair name(name) -> key pair type (RSA) -> private key file format(.pem) -> create key pair
-> login to the instance by using putty/mobaxterm ssh -i <private-key.pem> ubuntu@<public-IP-address>.
-> we need to change the permission of the .pem file because the password is too sensitive chmod 600 <private-key.pem>
-> whenever we login to the instance we need to update the packages -> sudo apt update 
-> Before we running any applications we need to download the requirements. for jenkins we need to download java packages
-> after installing running the public-IP-address of instance with the default port number http://<IP-address>:8080
-> then we need to enter the passwd which is in mentioned path after it will login successful.  
-> sudo su -
-> apt update
-> apt install openjdk-21-jdk    
#we need to install the supported version if u want to know the supported versions - tail -n 50 /var/log/syslog
-> java --version
-> sudo wget -O /usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc \
  https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian/jenkins.io-2023.key
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc]" \
  https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian binary/ | sudo tee \
  /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list > /dev/null
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install jenkins
-> systemctl status jenkins
-> http://<public-IP-address>:8080
-> we need to to set the inbound traffic rules - Custom TCP - 8080 - AnywhereIPV4 - save it
-> along with that we need to add ICMP V4 because need to pinig the public ip-address get back the packets details without any loss
   All ICMP-IPV4 - save it
-> ping <public-ip>

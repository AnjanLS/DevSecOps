==========
1.what is a computer?
A computer is an electronic device that processes and stores data, following instructions to perform various tasks. It consists of hardware 
(physical parts) and software (programs).


2.Client Server Architecture?
Client-server architecture is a model where a client (such as a computer or application) requests services or resources, and a server provides them. 
The client sends requests to the server, which processes them and returns the necessary data or response.If we can't access then we have troubleshoot.
eg:- facebook.com --> facebook application in facebook servers.
	 Web-Browser --> Client Software


RAM(Random access memory) - It's a computer's short-term memory that stores data the processor needs to run applications and open files. 
RAM is a critical component of a computer that works with the central processing unit (CPU).

Storage - the process of creating a permanent record of information in the brain. It's one of three fundamental stages of memory, along with encoding 
and retrieval.

OS(Operating System) - software that manages a computer's hardware and software resources, and allows users to interact with the computer's hardware.
It performs basic functions like memory and processor management, and error detection.

Processor - It is also known as a central processing unit (CPU), is the main component of a computer that controls the machine's operations.

Server (For hosting application) - a computer, software program, or storage device that provides resources, data, services, or programs to other 
computers, called clients,over a network. Servers are the core of computer operations, and are often used in data centers to power businesses. 
port forwarding --> To deploy application in our own laptop and open it in Internet.
---------------

ECC/EC2 (Elastic Cloud Computing) - It  is a default web service that allows users to rent virtual servers, or instances, to run applications in the cloud. 
EC2 is a popular service for hosting applications, running batch jobs, and other computing needs.
Instance = server = node

Firewall - It is a network security tool that monitors and controls traffic flow to protect network devices from potential threats.
*allow everyone through the traffic.
*Inbound-Incoming Traffic
*Outbound-Outgoing Traffic

AMI - Amazon machine Image
Image is also known as entire operating system and extention for Image is .iso(International organization for standardization)
ex: c:\windows
	Redhat Enterprise Linux = centos = Amazon Enterprise Linux = Fedora = AlmaLinux

3)Why we need OS?
Anything need to access from the Storage we need os because, the data which is stored in the HDD we can't see directly but the OS will connect with 
the hardware and interact with kernel through user interface. kernel is act like a brain of OS. It follows monolothic architecture.

Monolothic Architecture
------------------------
Applications
	^
    |
User Mode(Handles other OS features)

Kernel Mode(Handles only basic OS features like File-system/Process/Memory/I/O/Device Management and Concurrency.)

Hardware Machine

Linus Torvalds - Inventor of Linux - Invented Linux OS due to using other paid OS
----------------------------------
when we are buying a laptop we are purchasing both hardware and OS, In 1980's servers are using unix OS and personal laptop using IBM bios OS.
users don't have option, so Linus Torvalds developed Linux from the scratch by using c and it is open source similar like unix.
he developed kernel, the component which is connected to the hardware.
OS = Kernel + User Interface = Open Source

Linux Implementations/Distrinutions/Flavours(Used Linux kernel and developed their own Software) 
--------------------------------------------
RHEL
IBM AIX
Ubuntu 
Fedora
Solaris
Android
Suse, open source Linux Git - https://github.com/torvalds/linux

->opensource don't have support for the customers, if you have any problems post it in a community group they will respond and solve the issue.
->Enterprise they do have support and don't need to worry, If you are facing with any problem the support team will resolve the issue.

Authentication
--------------
1. What you know --> Username and Password
2. What you are --> Username and Token/OTP
3. What you have --> Fingerprints, Retina, Palm, etc.

A public key(.pub) and a private key(.pem) are a pair of keys that work together to encrypt and decrypt data in a public-key cryptosystem: 
Public key --> Can be shared with anyone and is used to encrypt messages or verify digital signatures
Private key --> Should only be known by the owner and is used to decrypt messages or create digital signatures

-> ssh-keygen -f <file-name> --> It generates public and private key.
-> Git bash is a SSH Client, Git Client, Mini Linux.
-> AWS Linux 2023 AMI(default-ec2 user)/Amazon Linux 2 AMI(HVM) - Free tier
-> t3.micro/t2.micro - Free tier
-> Public IP -> 18.205.151.148
-> We use protocol ssh for accessing to the linux server, default ssh port number is 22 and HTTP/HTTPs is 80/443.
-> there's a multiple services in server like mail, DB, FTP
-> for connecting to the server, ssh -i <Private-key> ec2-user@IP
-> ssh -i daws-82s.pem ec2-user@18.205.151.148 ,we are connecting to the server.

PWD -> Present working directory
C:\Users\anjan -> Windows Format
/c/Users/anjan -> Linux Format

ls -l -> List sub directories.

1. Create public and private key
2. Import public key
3. Create Firewall
4. Create Instance
5. Connect to Instance
6. Teminate when not using.

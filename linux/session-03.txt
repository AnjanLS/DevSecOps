Linux administration
--------------------
user management - the process of managing user access to the operating system and its resources.
eg: create user, add user to any group, etc

-> useradd <user-name> - creates new user and group with same name
-> /etc/passwd - contains user info
-> /etc/group - contains group info
-> id <user-name> - display user info
-> In linux user must have only one primary group and atleast secondary group
-> passwd <user-name> - sets password to the user
-> groupadd <group-name> - creates new group
-> usermod -g <group-name> <user-name> - add user to the primary group,g for primary
-> usermod -aG <group-name> <user-name> - add user to the secondary group,G for secondary
-> before removing user from the group, move him to some default group and for secondary aslo and then delete the user so the user don't have access to
   any groups.
   ex:  [root@ip-172-31-88-131 ~]# id anjan

-> /etc/ssh/sshd_config - edit the ssh related configuraton, If you made any mistakes in file then we can't ssh into server
-> systemctl restart sshd - it will restart the sshd, any changes if you made may apply
-> sshd -t - it will check the configuraton issues correct or not, -t for testing
-> key based authentication - we should generate public and private key, then the admin will attach our public key to the server so we can access the 
   server with private key and do not share private key with anyone in the company.
